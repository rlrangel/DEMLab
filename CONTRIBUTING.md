To modify the source code or files, create a [new branch][new_branch_link] from the master branch, and work on that branch to make the modifications.

Please check that all [tests](#testing) are passing after finishing the modifications to the source code.
In addition, it is recommended to create new models for testing the implemented features.

Always try to keep the code organized.
It includes choosing clear and representative names for functions and variables,
paying attention to alignments and spacing,
and avoiding leaving unused code blocks as comments.

After the implementations are complete, make a [merge request][merge_request_link].
